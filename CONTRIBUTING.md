# Contributing
If you're reading this, then great! You're obviously interested in contributing to this project in some capacity. Right now I've got no idea what is going to be required and what isn't, so someone to help keep track of everything would be great üòù. In all seriousness though, there is definitely going to be jobs for people to do and help contribute to this project. I'll try and address some concerns below.


### Programming / Development
Sure! Check the issues and projects section of this repo. They contain the currently required tasks. If you want to help with it then go nuts! All I ask is you try to keep to the same code style I'm currently using. Also all work should be done in Objective-C (and if you're working on the Ndat or Rez parser then in C).

### Testing
This is definitely going to be needed at somepoint, but it's a little early for this.

### Research
Finding good information about some of the older formats used by EV Nova would be massively helpful. Check tickets for ones related to resource forks and with help wanted tags.

### Donations
No. No donations will be accepted as part of this project. The goal is to create an open source game engine that can run the EV Nova data files and plugins. Whilst it appears the game is most likely abandonware now, Ambrosia Software does still exist in some slight capacity, and thus still own the rights to the game. To avoid any legal complications no monetary donations will be accepted.
