# OpenNova
As time marches onwards, macOS evolves further and further. This is a good thing in general. However it poses a problem to older classic/retro games, such as the Escape Velocity series of games. The technologies that they relied upon are either deprecated or soon to be.

### What does this mean?
Put simply, it means that there will come a time in which these great games will no longer be playable on the Mac. When this point in time is, is hard to say. It could be this year, next year or a decade down the line.

### A solution
This project is a potential solution to the issue. It aims to document and reimplement a lot of underlying technologies that the Escape Velocity games relied upon. ResourceForks and QuickDraw are the two major aspects. From there a newer modern version of the Nova game engine will be implemented.

The goal is to be able to take the original game data files and use them unmodified. This also means that total conversions for the game such as Polycon EV will also be able to be played as well.
